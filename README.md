Designing Super Fast Processor Powered By Light - A Ray Of Hope

This is one of my wildest dream ever. To design processor and primary memory for a Computing Device using light and some optical materials. The idea is to create a Computing Device that runs only on light i.e. without using conventional electronic component, with very high computing power (or speed).

Imagine one day sun rays fall on a device and it gets bootup and starts its job.

If you have any idea how to sort this out please donot hesitate to share with me.

The most basic component i.e. logic gates are already designed. i.e. NOT, AND, OR and one more gate is also possible XOR. 
Other components are to be designed i.e. memory components, optical oscillators etc.
