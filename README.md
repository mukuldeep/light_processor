Designing Super Fast Processor using Light - A Ray Of Hope

This is one of my wildest dream ever. To design processor and primary memory for a computer system Using light and some optical materials only.
If you have any idea how to sort this out please donot hesitate to share with me. you can commit here or send over email mukul@raabints.com .

The most basic component i.e. logic gates are already designed. i.e. NOT, AND, OR and one more gate is also possible XOR. 
Other components are to be designed i.e. memory components, optical oscillators etc.
